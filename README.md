# BLOCKCHAIN-AND-CRYPTOCURRENCY

# PROJECT AIMED:
Blockchain is one of the most secure emerging technologies in the IT industry. The inner workings of the blockchain are very complex but in simplified terms, the basic idea is to decentralize the storage of the data so that such data cannot be owned, controlled or manipulated by a central actor. This Technology is also sometimes reffered as Distributed Ledger Technology(DLT).
In current trend the main focus of the usage of this technology is in the form of cryptocurrencies, However it is rapidly growing in other sectors as well.
through this project i have implemnted a decentralized blockchain and a custom cryptocurrency named as "HARLECOIN", and also implemented a Smart contract for My cryptocurrency ICO(Initial Coin Offering).

# MODULE 1:
In this there is a simple implementation of the blockchain with its most basic functionality, woth this you can implement the most basic manual terminal based blockchain.

# MODULE 2: 
In this the blockchain is Decentralized with the help of the postman. We use Flask to deploy this blockchain as a web app and use postman on the localhost and create multiple nodes to implement a decentralized blockchain. you basically  need to create multiple nodes by using different port numbers in each node(The starting port number is 5000).

# Module 3:
In this the code was implemented on remix_IDE and the language used in this is solidity, which is the development language for developing smart contracts on Ethereum.
